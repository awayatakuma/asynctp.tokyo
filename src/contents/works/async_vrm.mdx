This is my personal VRM avatar created with VRoid Studio and featured on the top page of this portfolio. The model showcases a custom-designed character with detailed facial expressions and animations. Built using the VRM format for universal compatibility across various platforms and applications. The avatar serves as my digital representation in virtual environments and 3D web experiences. You can interact with the model through the Three.js-powered viewer on the homepage.
