## [sabidb](https://github.com/awayatakuma/sabidb)

This is my implementation of RDBMS in Rust.

This system can accept not only queries but also index, table creation. You can query the database with predication, outer join and so on.
This database system is also embedded basic transaction system and intake some advanced optimization such as multibuffers and heuristic query plans.
